## More 
The Bird Cam project is a Python script that can be used to record birds arriving at a feeding station on a balcony. The script uses OpenCV to capture the video and detect motion in the frame. When motion is detected, the script starts recording the video and saves it in the MP4 format. The recordings are saved in the ./videos/ folder with a timestamp as the filename.

The script can be easily modified to work with any camera that captures video. Furthermore it can also be used for other purposes, such as monitoring a room or keeping an eye on a pet.
